# hello-world
This is my  Unit 7 class assignment for my CS 81 class.

What's goog everybody!

My names is Omar Vargas. I am from East Los Angeles, California and I am excited to be learning how to do
web development. Today I've been on a 6 hour bike ride and I am exhausted. The hot weather really takes a toll on you.
